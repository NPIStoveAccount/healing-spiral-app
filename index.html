  // Dimension full descriptions
  "ground.desc": "Healing doesn't happen in isolation — it happens in connection. The quality of the relationship you're in during the work (with a therapist, a group, a partner, even yourself) determines whether real change happens or you're just going through the motions.",
  "capacity.desc": "Before you can safely explore painful material, your nervous system needs to be able to handle it. This means learning to calm yourself down, having people you feel safe with, and being able to move between feeling activated and feeling settled. This isn't a one-time thing — you need more capacity as you go deeper.",
  "completion.desc": "When something overwhelming happened, your body may have started to fight back, run, freeze up, or shut down — but couldn't finish. Those incomplete reactions are still stored in your body. Healing here means safely letting those responses complete. This is different from just venting — real completion leaves you feeling genuinely settled in a new way.",
  "affect.desc": "As the body releases, buried emotions come up — grief hiding under anger, fear hiding under numbness, longing hiding under independence. Healing here means staying present with feelings without acting on them, analyzing them, or pushing past them. It happens in waves, at its own pace.",
  "diff.desc": "Learning to tell the difference between then and now, between a feeling and the story about it, between a part of you and all of you. 'This is my five-year-old's fear, not my adult reality.' Without body and emotional work first, this just stays in your head.",
  "models.desc": "Deep down, your nervous system carries beliefs formed during hard times: 'people always leave,' 'I'm too much,' 'I have to earn love.' These only change when the old belief gets activated AND something genuinely different happens AND you notice the difference. This is why just understanding your patterns isn't enough — you need new experiences.",
  "identity.desc": "As enough old beliefs update, the sense of self they held together starts to shift. 'The strong one,' 'the wounded one,' 'the caretaker' — these identities start feeling less solid. This can't be rushed. It happens naturally when enough has shifted underneath. Trying to force it leads to pretending rather than real change.",
  "energetic.desc": "Sometimes there are shifts happening in the body that are subtler than muscle tension but more physical than emotions or thoughts. Different traditions call these energy, qi, prana, or describe channels and centers in the body. This dimension has its own timing and sometimes moves independently of the other work.",
  "shadow.desc": "The other dimensions deal with things that are stuck. This one deals with things you've actively pushed away — parts of yourself you've decided are unacceptable. The mechanism isn't releasing or processing but welcoming back what was rejected. At every level of healing, there are things that were forbidden, not just unfelt. Full healing means going to exactly those places.",
  // Theory tab
  "theory.trauma.1": "When something overwhelming happens, your mind and body do smart things to survive — you might freeze, shut down, people-please, or disconnect. The problem is that those survival strategies keep running even when you're safe now. They live in your body as tension and bracing, in your mind as beliefs like 'people can't be trusted,' and in your sense of self as rigid stories about who you are.",
  "theory.trauma.2": "Healing means making contact with what you couldn't handle at the time, and letting it finally be processed. You're not broken — something got interrupted, and it needs to be completed.",
  "theory.dims": "Rather than a step-by-step process, healing works across nine different areas. Seven build on each other in a natural direction — body before meaning, ground before depth — but they're in constant conversation with each other. The direction is real, but the process is a dialogue, not a staircase. Two more areas weave through everything. Each has different tools that work best, and different ways of getting stuck.",
  "theory.spiral.1": "There's a natural direction — you need to feel safe enough before going deep, body work comes before deep emotional work, feeling before insight — but the areas are in constant conversation. Body releases bring up buried emotions, and feeling buried emotions can unlock body patterns. It's a conversation between the areas, not a staircase through them. Each time around, you go deeper as new material becomes available from a more stable foundation.",
  "theory.spiral.2": "These areas aren't really separate — a body sensation IS an emotion IS a belief IS a relationship pattern, all at once. It matters less where you start than how fully you show up.",
  "theory.modality.1": "Every healing approach is good at some things and limited at others. Body-based work is great at releasing physical tension but doesn't directly change your beliefs about relationships. Meditation develops deep awareness but can leave relationship patterns untouched. Talking helps you understand patterns but rarely releases a physical survival response.",
  "theory.modality.2": "This tool maps over 50 different approaches across all nine areas, showing what each one is good at and what it misses. The goal isn't to try everything — it's to see clearly what your current practice covers and where the gaps are.",
  "theory.shadow.1": "You can do real healing work in every other area while avoiding the things you've truly rejected about yourself. You can release safe body tensions while the forbidden impulses stay frozen. You can feel acceptable emotions while the scary ones stay locked away.",
  "theory.shadow.2": "Shadow work feels different from other healing — it's not about finishing something that got interrupted, but about welcoming back something that was kicked out. The anger the 'nice person' won't own. The vulnerability the 'strong one' has walled off. The desire the 'spiritual one' has risen above. Wholeness means nothing left out of who you are.",
  // Coherence
  "theory.coherence.1": "Here's the key insight: your system isn't broken. It's organized — just organized around survival. Every body pattern, every relationship prediction, every identity structure fits together with its own logic. The 'strong one' who can't feel vulnerability, the body that won't let go, the belief that closeness is dangerous — these aren't random problems. They're a coherent system of self-protection that made sense when it was built.",
  "theory.coherence.2": "Healing doesn't make a broken system work. It reorganizes what the system is built around. Instead of being organized around old wounds and survival, you develop a system organized around wholeness — nothing excluded, nothing frozen, nothing split off.",
  // Integrity
  "theory.integrity.1": "Integrity here doesn't mean moral goodness — though that tends to follow — but structural wholeness. Nothing left out of your experience of yourself. A system organized around old wounds keeps itself together by cutting things out: the 'strong one' cuts out vulnerability; the 'spiritual one' cuts out the animal; the 'nice one' cuts out aggression. Everything fits — but at the cost of amputating whole parts of who you are.",
  "theory.integrity.2": "A system organized around wholeness keeps itself together by including everything. Nothing is banished. Vulnerability and strength coexist. Kindness includes the capacity for fierceness. Everything fits — and nothing is missing.",
  "theory.integrity.3": "This is why shadow work isn't optional. Without it, you can build a new version of yourself that's still organized around cutting things out — just a more polished, spiritually sophisticated version of the same pattern. You can meditate your way to calm while your anger stays frozen. You can build a new identity still defined by what it won't include — just harder to spot.",
  // Contradictory Beliefs
  "theory.contradict.1": "Sometimes you carry beliefs that directly contradict each other — not just mixed feelings, but deep structural opposites. 'I must be strong to survive' AND 'I am fundamentally helpless.' 'I must earn love' AND 'real love can't be earned.' 'Connection is what I need most' AND 'connection is what hurts me most.' These aren't just ideas — they live in your nervous system as your body trying to go in two directions at once.",
  "theory.contradict.2": "A single painful belief is at least stable — you can settle into it, even if it hurts. Contradictory beliefs don't allow even that. When two core beliefs pull opposite directions, you're always activated because you can't settle into either one. Over time this creates chronic shame, inability to make decisions, a constant sense of being a fraud, and physical wear: exhaustion, inflammation, sleep problems, and pain that doctors can't explain.",
  "theory.contradict.3": "The way through runs through the same process: build enough stability to hold both truths at once without collapsing. Let the body finish what was interrupted on both sides. Feel what's underneath both poles. See clearly: this was true then, in that specific situation. Discover through new experience that the opposites can coexist — strength and vulnerability in the same moment, in the same body. Shadow work is often essential here, because one side of the contradiction is usually the hidden one.",
  "theory.compass.1": "When healing feels stuck, the most useful question is: what am I avoiding? The area you least want to look at is usually the one you most need. The body worker who never does group work. The meditator who never lets themselves feel. The therapy client who never lets their body move. The ceremony-goer who never does the slow daily work.",
  "theory.compass.2": "Use the other tabs to see the full framework, check your own program for gaps, understand common pitfalls, and find where you might be stuck.",
  // Theory dimension list
  "theory.ground": "Healing happens in connection. Whether someone is truly present and attuned with you determines whether anything really changes or you're just going through motions. Your deepest wounds formed in relationship; they heal in relationship.",
  "theory.capacity": "Your nervous system needs to be stable enough to handle what comes up. This means being able to calm yourself (internally) and having safe people around you (externally). This isn't something you check off — as you go deeper, you need more stability.",
  "theory.completion": "Your body holds reactions it never got to finish — hands that wanted to push, legs that wanted to run, a chest that wanted to open. Completion means safely letting those responses happen. Different from dramatic release — real completion leaves you feeling settled in a genuinely new way.",
  "theory.affect": "As your body releases, buried feelings surface — grief under anger, fear under numbness, longing under self-sufficiency. Healing here means staying with those feelings without acting on them, explaining them away, or trying to rise above them. A slow digestion that comes in waves.",
  "theory.diff": "'This is the child's fear, not my adult reality.' Telling apart past from present, a part of you from all of you, a feeling from the story about it. Without body and emotional work first, this becomes just intellectual understanding.",
  "theory.models": "Your nervous system carries beliefs from hard times: 'people leave,' 'I'm too much.' These change only when the belief gets activated, something genuinely different happens, and you notice. Understanding alone doesn't heal — new experience is what changes things.",
  "theory.identity": "As enough beliefs update, the identity built on them starts to dissolve. 'The wounded one,' 'the strong one,' 'the helper' — loosening. Can't be forced; happens when enough has shifted underneath. Two levels: specific identities soften ('the achiever' starts feeling like a strategy rather than truth), and more rarely, the whole project of maintaining a fixed identity loses its urgency. The second tends to emerge naturally from enough cascade work.",
  "theory.energetic": "Subtler than muscle tension, more physical than emotions or thoughts. Traditional systems describe energy channels, centers, and flows. This area has its own rhythm — sometimes it moves first, sometimes last, sometimes it's the catalyst. Needs a soft, open quality of attention. A note on honesty: eight areas of this framework have mechanisms that can be named. This one can only be described by the experience of it. It's included because the experience is real and significant, not because it's as well understood as the others.",
  "theory.shadow": "Other areas work with what's stuck. This one works with what you've actively rejected — pushed out of your sense of self. The mechanism isn't releasing or processing but welcoming back what was exiled. At every level, there are things that were forbidden, not just unfelt. Real wholeness means going to exactly the places you've organized your life to avoid.",

  // Dimension full descriptions
  "ground.desc": "Healing doesn't happen in isolation — it happens in connection. The quality of the relationship you're in during the work (with a therapist, a group, a partner, even yourself) determines whether real change happens or you're just going through the motions.",
  "capacity.desc": "Before you can safely explore painful material, your nervous system needs to be able to handle it. This means learning to calm yourself down, having people you feel safe with, and being able to move between feeling activated and feeling settled. This isn't a one-time thing — you need more capacity as you go deeper.",
  "completion.desc": "When something overwhelming happened, your body may have started to fight back, run, freeze up, or shut down — but couldn't finish. Those incomplete reactions are still stored in your body. Healing here means safely letting those responses complete. This is different from just venting — real completion leaves you feeling genuinely settled in a new way.",
  "affect.desc": "As the body releases, buried emotions come up — grief hiding under anger, fear hiding under numbness, longing hiding under independence. Healing here means staying present with feelings without acting on them, analyzing them, or pushing past them. It happens in waves, at its own pace.",
  "diff.desc": "Learning to tell the difference between then and now, between a feeling and the story about it, between a part of you and all of you. 'This is my five-year-old's fear, not my adult reality.' Without body and emotional work first, this just stays in your head.",
  "models.desc": "Deep down, your nervous system carries beliefs formed during hard times: 'people always leave,' 'I'm too much,' 'I have to earn love.' These only change when the old belief gets activated AND something genuinely different happens AND you notice the difference. This is why just understanding your patterns isn't enough — you need new experiences.",
  "identity.desc": "As enough old beliefs update, the sense of self they held together starts to shift. 'The strong one,' 'the wounded one,' 'the caretaker' — these identities start feeling less solid. This can't be rushed. It happens naturally when enough has shifted underneath. Trying to force it leads to pretending rather than real change.",
  "energetic.desc": "Sometimes there are shifts happening in the body that are subtler than muscle tension but more physical than emotions or thoughts. Different traditions call these energy, qi, prana, or describe channels and centers in the body. This dimension has its own timing and sometimes moves independently of the other work.",
  "shadow.desc": "The other dimensions deal with things that are stuck. This one deals with things you've actively pushed away — parts of yourself you've decided are unacceptable. The mechanism isn't releasing or processing but welcoming back what was rejected. At every level of healing, there are things that were forbidden, not just unfelt. Full healing means going to exactly those places.",
  // Theory tab
  "theory.trauma.1": "When something overwhelming happens, your mind and body do smart things to survive — you might freeze, shut down, people-please, or disconnect. The problem is that those survival strategies keep running even when you're safe now. They live in your body as tension and bracing, in your mind as beliefs like 'people can't be trusted,' and in your sense of self as rigid stories about who you are.",
  "theory.trauma.2": "Healing means making contact with what you couldn't handle at the time, and letting it finally be processed. You're not broken — something got interrupted, and it needs to be completed.",
  "theory.dims": "Rather than a step-by-step process, healing works across nine different areas. Seven build on each other in a natural direction — body before meaning, ground before depth — but they're in constant conversation with each other. The direction is real, but the process is a dialogue, not a staircase. Two more areas weave through everything. Each has different tools that work best, and different ways of getting stuck.",
  "theory.spiral.1": "There's a natural direction — you need to feel safe enough before going deep, body work comes before deep emotional work, feeling before insight — but the areas are in constant conversation. Body releases bring up buried emotions, and feeling buried emotions can unlock body patterns. It's a conversation between the areas, not a staircase through them. Each time around, you go deeper as new material becomes available from a more stable foundation.",
  "theory.spiral.2": "These areas aren't really separate — a body sensation IS an emotion IS a belief IS a relationship pattern, all at once. It matters less where you start than how fully you show up.",
  "theory.modality.1": "Every healing approach is good at some things and limited at others. Body-based work is great at releasing physical tension but doesn't directly change your beliefs about relationships. Meditation develops deep awareness but can leave relationship patterns untouched. Talking helps you understand patterns but rarely releases a physical survival response.",
  "theory.modality.2": "This tool maps over 50 different approaches across all nine areas, showing what each one is good at and what it misses. The goal isn't to try everything — it's to see clearly what your current practice covers and where the gaps are.",
  "theory.shadow.1": "You can do real healing work in every other area while avoiding the things you've truly rejected about yourself. You can release safe body tensions while the forbidden impulses stay frozen. You can feel acceptable emotions while the scary ones stay locked away.",
  "theory.shadow.2": "Shadow work feels different from other healing — it's not about finishing something that got interrupted, but about welcoming back something that was kicked out. The anger the 'nice person' won't own. The vulnerability the 'strong one' has walled off. The desire the 'spiritual one' has risen above. Wholeness means nothing left out of who you are.",
  // Coherence
  "theory.coherence.1": "Here's the key insight: your system isn't broken. It's organized — just organized around survival. Every body pattern, every relationship prediction, every identity structure fits together with its own logic. The 'strong one' who can't feel vulnerability, the body that won't let go, the belief that closeness is dangerous — these aren't random problems. They're a coherent system of self-protection that made sense when it was built.",
  "theory.coherence.2": "Healing doesn't make a broken system work. It reorganizes what the system is built around. Instead of being organized around old wounds and survival, you develop a system organized around wholeness — nothing excluded, nothing frozen, nothing split off.",
  // Integrity
  "theory.integrity.1": "Integrity here doesn't mean moral goodness — though that tends to follow — but structural wholeness. Nothing left out of your experience of yourself. A system organized around old wounds keeps itself together by cutting things out: the 'strong one' cuts out vulnerability; the 'spiritual one' cuts out the animal; the 'nice one' cuts out aggression. Everything fits — but at the cost of amputating whole parts of who you are.",
  "theory.integrity.2": "A system organized around wholeness keeps itself together by including everything. Nothing is banished. Vulnerability and strength coexist. Kindness includes the capacity for fierceness. Everything fits — and nothing is missing.",
  "theory.integrity.3": "This is why shadow work isn't optional. Without it, you can build a new version of yourself that's still organized around cutting things out — just a more polished, spiritually sophisticated version of the same pattern. You can meditate your way to calm while your anger stays frozen. You can build a new identity still defined by what it won't include — just harder to spot.",
  // Contradictory Beliefs
  "theory.contradict.1": "Sometimes you carry beliefs that directly contradict each other — not just mixed feelings, but deep structural opposites. 'I must be strong to survive' AND 'I am fundamentally helpless.' 'I must earn love' AND 'real love can't be earned.' 'Connection is what I need most' AND 'connection is what hurts me most.' These aren't just ideas — they live in your nervous system as your body trying to go in two directions at once.",
  "theory.contradict.2": "A single painful belief is at least stable — you can settle into it, even if it hurts. Contradictory beliefs don't allow even that. When two core beliefs pull opposite directions, you're always activated because you can't settle into either one. Over time this creates chronic shame, inability to make decisions, a constant sense of being a fraud, and physical wear: exhaustion, inflammation, sleep problems, and pain that doctors can't explain.",
  "theory.contradict.3": "The way through runs through the same process: build enough stability to hold both truths at once without collapsing. Let the body finish what was interrupted on both sides. Feel what's underneath both poles. See clearly: this was true then, in that specific situation. Discover through new experience that the opposites can coexist — strength and vulnerability in the same moment, in the same body. Shadow work is often essential here, because one side of the contradiction is usually the hidden one.",
  "theory.compass.1": "When healing feels stuck, the most useful question is: what am I avoiding? The area you least want to look at is usually the one you most need. The body worker who never does group work. The meditator who never lets themselves feel. The therapy client who never lets their body move. The ceremony-goer who never does the slow daily work.",
  "theory.compass.2": "Use the other tabs to see the full framework, check your own program for gaps, understand common pitfalls, and find where you might be stuck.",
  // Theory dimension list
  "theory.ground": "Healing happens in connection. Whether someone is truly present and attuned with you determines whether anything really changes or you're just going through motions. Your deepest wounds formed in relationship; they heal in relationship.",
  "theory.capacity": "Your nervous system needs to be stable enough to handle what comes up. This means being able to calm yourself (internally) and having safe people around you (externally). This isn't something you check off — as you go deeper, you need more stability.",
  "theory.completion": "Your body holds reactions it never got to finish — hands that wanted to push, legs that wanted to run, a chest that wanted to open. Completion means safely letting those responses happen. Different from dramatic release — real completion leaves you feeling settled in a genuinely new way.",
  "theory.affect": "As your body releases, buried feelings surface — grief under anger, fear under numbness, longing under self-sufficiency. Healing here means staying with those feelings without acting on them, explaining them away, or trying to rise above them. A slow digestion that comes in waves.",
  "theory.diff": "'This is the child's fear, not my adult reality.' Telling apart past from present, a part of you from all of you, a feeling from the story about it. Without body and emotional work first, this becomes just intellectual understanding.",
  "theory.models": "Your nervous system carries beliefs from hard times: 'people leave,' 'I'm too much.' These change only when the belief gets activated, something genuinely different happens, and you notice. Understanding alone doesn't heal — new experience is what changes things.",
  "theory.identity": "As enough beliefs update, the identity built on them starts to dissolve. 'The wounded one,' 'the strong one,' 'the helper' — loosening. Can't be forced; happens when enough has shifted underneath. Two levels: specific identities soften ('the achiever' starts feeling like a strategy rather than truth), and more rarely, the whole project of maintaining a fixed identity loses its urgency. The second tends to emerge naturally from enough cascade work.",
  "theory.energetic": "Subtler than muscle tension, more physical than emotions or thoughts. Traditional systems describe energy channels, centers, and flows. This area has its own rhythm — sometimes it moves first, sometimes last, sometimes it's the catalyst. Needs a soft, open quality of attention. A note on honesty: eight areas of this framework have mechanisms that can be named. This one can only be described by the experience of it. It's included because the experience is real and significant, not because it's as well understood as the others.",
  "theory.shadow": "Other areas work with what's stuck. This one works with what you've actively rejected — pushed out of your sense of self. The mechanism isn't releasing or processing but welcoming back what was exiled. At every level, there are things that were forbidden, not just unfelt. Real wholeness means going to exactly the places you've organized your life to avoid.",
  // Compass/diagnostic
  "compass.capacity.q": "Do I feel stable enough for what's coming up?",
  "compass.capacity.body": "Notice your breathing. Is it shallow and tight in your chest? Do you feel a background buzz of anxiety, or a settled weight in your belly? Can you feel your feet on the floor?",
  "compass.capacity.stuck": "You know you need to go deeper but every time you try, you end up more rattled, not more healed. Sleep gets worse. You can't calm down between sessions. The work feels like it's making things worse.",
  "compass.capacity.invite": "This isn't failure — it's useful information. Your container needs to get bigger before more can safely surface. Building stability isn't avoiding the real work; it's what makes the real work possible.",
  "compass.completion.q": "Is my body still holding onto something it never got to finish?",
  "compass.completion.body": "Scan for bracing — jaw, shoulders, fists, pelvic floor. Is there a push that never got pushed, a run that never got run? Do your hands want to do something your mind won't allow?",
  "compass.completion.stuck": "You understand your patterns in your head but your body hasn't caught up. Tension persists despite insight. You freeze up in safe situations. Your body is still living in the old scene.",
  "compass.completion.invite": "Your body doesn't care about your insights. It needs to finish what it started — not dramatically, but at its own pace. Completion isn't venting; it's the body arriving somewhere genuinely new.",
  "compass.affect.q": "Am I willing to feel what I haven't felt yet?",
  "compass.affect.body": "What emotion is just below the surface right now? Not the one you can easily name, but the one underneath that. Is there sadness under your anger? Fear under your numbness? Longing under your independence?",
  "compass.affect.stuck": "You can talk about your feelings but don't quite feel them in your body — or you feel the easy ones while the deeper layer stays locked. Something is waiting that your system won't let through yet.",
  "compass.affect.invite": "Processing emotions isn't dramatic. It's staying with a wave of feeling without acting on it, explaining it away, or rising above it. Thirty seconds of genuinely feeling unfelt grief changes more than a year of talking about it.",
  "compass.diff.q": "Can I tell the difference between what's old and what's now?",
  "compass.diff.body": "When you're triggered — in a fight, a panic, a wave of feeling — can you notice: 'this is the child's experience, not what's actually happening now'? Or does the past completely flood the present?",
  "compass.diff.stuck": "You react to current situations with the intensity of old ones. Your partner becomes your parent. A coworker's feedback becomes childhood rejection. You can see it happening but can't stop it.",
  "compass.diff.invite": "This isn't about suppressing reactions — it's about growing your awareness to hold both realities. 'Yes, I feel abandoned AND I can see this person just needed space.' The 'and' is everything.",
  "compass.models.q": "Am I having genuinely new experiences, or repeating old patterns?",
  "compass.models.body": "Think of a recent relationship moment that felt charged. Did something new happen — or did you steer things to confirm what you already believed? Did you let yourself be surprised?",
  "compass.models.stuck": "You keep ending up in the same situations despite understanding the pattern. You choose people who confirm your fears. You act in ways that make your worst predictions come true. Understanding hasn't broken the loop.",
  "compass.models.invite": "Old beliefs don't change through understanding — they change through experience. The belief has to be active, something genuinely different has to happen, and you have to be present enough to notice. This is why relationships are where the real work happens.",
  "compass.identity.q": "Am I holding onto a version of myself that's ready to change?",
  "compass.identity.body": "Who are you in your healing journey? The strong one? The wounded one? The helper? The seeker? Feel into that identity — does it still fit, or is it starting to feel like a costume?",
  "compass.identity.stuck": "You've done real work but built a new identity around it. 'The person who's been through a lot.' 'The one who does deep work.' Your sense of self has updated but it's still rigid — and it's starting to feel tight.",
  "compass.identity.invite": "Identity change can't be forced — it happens when enough has shifted underneath that the old structure can't hold. It's disorienting and often brings grief. It's not failure; it's the natural result of all the work you've done.",
  "compass.energetic.q": "Am I paying attention to what's subtler than emotion but more physical than thought?",
  "compass.energetic.body": "Close your eyes. Can you sense the quality of aliveness in different areas of your body — not muscle tension, not emotion, but something more like a current, or heaviness, or spaciousness? Places that feel open vs. places that feel stuck?",
  "compass.energetic.stuck": "You've done psychological and body work but something won't shift. There's a quality to the stuckness below the level of feelings or stories — more like a channel that's blocked, an area that feels dead or congested.",
  "compass.energetic.invite": "This area needs a different kind of attention — softer, more open, less goal-driven. It often responds to practices your rational mind dismisses. That dismissal itself might be worth looking at.",
  "compass.shadow.q": "What have I rejected about myself?",
  "compass.shadow.body": "Think of a quality you really dislike in other people — selfishness, neediness, aggression, manipulation. Now ask: where does that live in me? Notice what your body does with that question. The flinch IS the information.",
  "compass.shadow.stuck": "Your work is genuine but it circles around certain topics. You heal the acceptable stuff and leave the forbidden stuff alone. You've become more compassionate but never faced your cruelty. More open but never owned your power. More spiritual but never looked at your hunger.",
  "compass.shadow.invite": "Shadow work isn't about becoming your worst fear — it's about ending the war against parts of yourself. What you reject doesn't disappear; it runs your life from underground. Welcoming it back doesn't make you dangerous. It makes you whole.",
  // Traps

Or: you've had genuine spiritual experiences, real spaciousness — but your body is still tense and your relationships still hit the same walls. The mind gets it. The body didn't get the memo.",
  "trap.0.antidote": "Add body-based work. Let the understanding land in the nervous system. Body-based practices, breathwork, movement. The body has to move before the mind's maps become real.",
  "trap.1.desc": "Going deeper than your nervous system and life can hold.",
  "trap.1.looks": "You keep having powerful experiences that don't stick. The retreat cracked you open, the ceremony was profound — and two weeks later you're back to baseline. Or worse, more destabilized than before. The opening exceeded what your nervous system and life could hold. More intensity isn't what's needed. More ground is.",
  "trap.1.antidote": "Build stability and safe relationships before going deeper. Calming practices, grounding skills, ongoing community. The container has to match the opening.",
  "trap.2.desc": "The healing journey has become a fixed identity or a way to avoid going deep.",
  "trap.2.looks": "'Doing my work' has become a central part of how you see yourself. You judge others by whether they're 'doing their work.'

      ground: "The medium in which all healing occurs. Quality of presence, attunement, co-regulation, and witnessing determines whether anything else shifts or is merely performed. Developmental trauma happened in relationship; it resolves in relationship.",
      capacity: "The nervous system needs enough resources to enter difficult territory without overwhelm. Both internal regulation (pendulation between activation and settling) and external safety (relational holding). This isn't a stage you complete — it scales with depth throughout the spiral.",
      completion: "The body holds incomplete fight, flight, freeze, fawn, and collapse responses. Completion means finishing what was started: hands push, legs run, chest opens. Different from catharsis — genuine completion produces spontaneous settling and a new physiological baseline.",
      affect: "As the body completes, frozen emotional material surfaces — grief under anger, terror under numbness, longing under self-sufficiency. Metabolization is sustained conscious contact with feeling: not acting it out, not analyzing it, not transcending it. A slow digestive process that comes in waves.",
      diff: "Past from present. Part from whole self. Feeling from story. Awareness from content. As affect metabolizes, you see: 'this is the child's grief, not my adult reality.' Without somatic and affect work first, differentiation becomes mere intellectual mapping.",
      models: "The nervous system runs predictions formed under duress: 'people leave,' 'my needs are too much.' These update only when the old prediction is active AND met with disconfirming experience AND you're differentiated enough to notice the mismatch. This is why insight alone doesn't heal — corrective relational experience is the mechanism.",
      identity: "As enough implicit models update, the identity they supported loses coherence. 'The wounded one,' 'the strong one,' 'the helper' — dissolving. Can't be forced; premature attempts produce spiritual bypass. Two levels: structural loosening (specific identities soften) and, more rarely, dissolution of the identity project itself (questions like 'am I enough?' stop being live questions rather than getting better answers).",
      energetic: "More granular than muscular tension, more embodied than parts or meaning. Traditional systems map as meridians, chakras, nadis. This dimension operates somewhat independently — sometimes preceding, sometimes following, sometimes catalyzing the cascade. Requires soft, receptive attention. A note on epistemological honesty: eight dimensions of this framework have mechanisms that can be named. This one can only be described phenomenologically. It is included because the experience is real and clinically significant, not because it is as well understood as the others.",
      shadow: "Other dimensions work with what's stuck. This dimension works with what's split off — actively excluded from self-experience. The mechanism isn't completion or metabolization but re-owning what was banished. Integrity as structural wholeness: nothing left out. At every level of the cascade, there's material that was forbidden rather than merely unfelt. Full integration requires going to exactly the places the system has organized itself to avoid."
